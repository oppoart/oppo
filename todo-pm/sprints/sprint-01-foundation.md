## Definition of Done Checklist

For each story to be considered complete:
- [ ] Implementation completed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tested with other modules
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Privacy requirements verified
- [ ] Local processing confirmed

## Sprint Risks

### Identified Risks
1. **Technology Stack Learning Curve**: Team may need time to learn NestJS, TypeORM, or transformers.js
   - *Mitigation*: Allocate time for research and create proof-of-concept examples

2. **Local AI Processing Performance**: Uncertainty about on-device AI model performance
   - *Mitigation*: Early testing with sample models and fallback strategies

### Dependencies
- Node.js and npm setup
- Development environment configuration
- Access to transformers.js documentation
