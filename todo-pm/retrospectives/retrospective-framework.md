# Retrospective and Improvement Framework

## Overview

This framework defines the retrospective process for the OPPO project, ensuring continuous improvement through structured reflection, learning, and adaptation. The retrospective process is designed to be lightweight but effective for small teams working on complex AI-driven systems.

## Retrospective Principles

### Core Values
1. **Psychological Safety**: Open, honest communication without blame
2. **Continuous Learning**: Every experience is a learning opportunity  
3. **Action-Oriented**: Focus on actionable improvements
4. **Data-Driven**: Use metrics and evidence to guide decisions
5. **Team Ownership**: Team-driven identification and implementation of improvements

### Success Metrics
- **Improvement Implementation Rate**: % of action items completed
- **Team Satisfaction**: Measured through feedback
- **Process Efficiency**: Sprint-over-sprint improvements
- **Quality Metrics**: Defect rates, rework, etc.

## Retrospective Types

### 1. Sprint Retrospectives
- **Frequency**: End of every sprint (bi-weekly)
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes for small teams
- **Participants**: Full development team
- **Focus**: Sprint-specific learnings and immediate improvements

### 2. Release Retrospectives  
- **Frequency**: After major releases or milestones
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Participants**: Extended team including stakeholders
- **Focus**: Broader systemic improvements and strategic adjustments

### 3. Incident Retrospectives
- **Frequency**: After significant issues or failures
- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes
- **Participants**: Affected team members
- **Focus**: Root cause analysis and prevention

### 4. Quarterly Retrospectives
- **Frequency**: Every quarter
- **Duration**: Half day
- **Participants**: Full team and key stakeholders
- **Focus**: Strategic process improvements and team development
